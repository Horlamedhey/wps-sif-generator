# Vercel Web Analytics Configuration for SvelteKit

## Summary
Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics with environment-aware mode detection for this SvelteKit application.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte**
   - Added import for `dev` from `$app/environment`
   - Updated `injectAnalytics()` call to include mode parameter: `{ mode: dev ? 'development' : 'production' }`
   - This ensures analytics runs in development mode during local development and production mode when deployed

2. **frontend/package-lock.json**
   - Updated lockfile after running `npm install` to ensure dependencies are properly resolved
   - The @vercel/analytics package was already present in package.json dependencies

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows SvelteKit best practices by:
- Using the built-in `$app/environment` module to detect the environment
- Configuring analytics mode based on the `dev` flag (true in development, false in production)
- Preserving all existing code structure and functionality
- Maintaining the existing theme and language detection logic in the layout

## Verification

The changes were verified by:
1. Running `npm install` to update dependencies and lockfile
2. Running `npm run build` which completed successfully
3. Build output shows the application compiles correctly with no errors
4. The analytics package is properly imported and configured

## Note

The @vercel/analytics package (v1.6.1) was already installed in the project dependencies, so no additional package installation was required. The changes only involved updating the configuration to use environment-aware mode detection.
